# Reecle-VHack-

Problem Statement : We all have items that are no longer of use and want to get rid of them, but being unable to find the proper way or place for them, we usually throw them away carelessly, affecting the "ENVIRONMENT"

Objective: The objective of our app is to deliver a solution that successfully manages the E-waste to be recycled and reused again.

Solution: Nothing is wasted, but it becomes one when it is in the wrong place, who has the time to sort it and put it in its right place. That's what Reecle- the app does! puts your waste in the right place. Not every waste is landfill, take a step towards a greener earthSo, with this idea, we bring to you THE REECLE where a user just needs to install the app select date, time, and address according to their convenience, and people will pick up the scrap material from their house and pay you in exchange for it.
